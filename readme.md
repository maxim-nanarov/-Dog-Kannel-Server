# Setup your development environment

* Install Node.js and npm
* Install TypeScript globally via npm
* Install PostgreSQL

## Initialize your project

* Create a new directory for your project
* Initialize a new Node.js project with npm init               
* Install necessary packages like ``express``, `pg` (`PostgreSQL` client for `Node`.js),    `typescript`, `ts-node`, `@types/node`, `@types/express`                
* Initialize a new TypeScript configuration file with ``tsc --init``                 

## Setup your PostgreSQL database        

* Create a new database in PostgreSQL         
* Install a database management tool like pgAdmin if you prefer a GUI     
* Create tables as per your requirements
## Setup your Express server                

* Create a new server.ts file    
* Import express and setup a basic server
      

## Connect your server to the database                 
* Use pg package to connect your Express server to PostgreSQL database                 
* Write functions to perform CRUD operations                          

## Setup routes                              
* Define routes for your server             
* Each route should correspond to a database operation           

## Testing    
* Write unit tests for your routes
* Use a library like jest for testing

## Debugging and error handling
* Add necessary error handling to your server
* Use console.log or a logging library to help with debugging

## Deployment
* Choose a cloud service provider (Azure)
* Follow their instructions to deploy your server and database
